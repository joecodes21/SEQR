# SEQR
Hello everyone!

I'm excited to introduce you to SEQR, an Android mobile application that we've developed using Android Studios and Python, seamlessly bridged by the Chaquopy-Python SDK.

Originally conceived as our final year graduation project, SEQR has evolved into a project that we're actively developing for a full-fledged release on the Android platform. We're committed to enhancing its functionality and delivering a comprehensive and user-friendly application for Android users.

Stay tuned for updates and feel free to explore the repository! Your feedback and support are highly valued.
